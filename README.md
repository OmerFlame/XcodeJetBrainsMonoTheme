# XcodeJetBrainsMonoTheme
Default (Dark) Xcode theme, but with JetBrains Mono.

I was tired of making it from scratch all the time so I just made the theme template, copied it and stuck it in a repo.

This will be forever licenseless, because everyone can create this file on their own using Xcode.

## How to Install
```
cd ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OmerFlame/XcodeJetBrainsMonoTheme/main/JetBrains%20Mono%20Default%20(Dark).xccolortheme"
```
